    <h1>Quality of our Perfume</h1><br>
    <h3>When I first started dabbling in fragrance, I figured out quickly that expensive perfumes were generally the most hyped. But I was a ~woman on a mission~ to smell really frickin' good and spend as little as possible doing it. So, I stocked my vanity with the best cheap perfumes. Shockingly, my collection was actually filled with gems, from delicious vanilla perfumes to fruity body sprays to layered patchouli fragrances. But it def took a whole lotta testing to sniff out (hehe) the gems.

I narrowed down the 14 best cheap perfumes for you (on the low low, ofc), from cozy winter perfumes to bright summer fragrances and so much more. FYI: They're all under $70, so you can rest easy that your bank account won't be screaming at you after you hit "add to cart." A lil sneak peek of my newest favorites:</h3>
